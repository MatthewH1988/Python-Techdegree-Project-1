 Number Guessing Game
Game generates a random number between 0 and 10 and allows user to guess the number until user guesses correctly. An incorrect guess by the user will generate a hint (ie whether the number is higher or lower than user's guess). Once user guesses the correct number, user will be notified the number of attempts it took to receive the correct number.
